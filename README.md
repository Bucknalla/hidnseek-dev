# HidnSeek Development Kit
This repository contains the documentation for the HidnSeek to be used as a SIGFOX Development Kit. Much of the core device functionality such as its sports mode and low power loops have been abstracted away to allow for a developer to call these methods into their own projects. 

Built on the ATMega328P chip (same as the Arduino Uno), the HidnSeek makes for a fantastic kit to start developing your own SIGFOX projects. The device consists of user accessible -

* TD 1207 SIGFOX Module
* MMA8653 Accelerometer
* BMP180 Barometer/Pressure Sensor
* MTK MT3339 GPS
* MCP7383 1/2 LiPo Charging Circuit
* UART and I2C Interfaces

You can find documentation outlining all of the accessible methods for the HidnSeek as well as example sketches and templates to get started with the device.
